### New month resolution

I decided to create a simple static blog. 

The only idea is to post every day only one small thing I focused on or being asked for.

- How to install ruby locally on macOS [manual](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)
 
- install `homebrew` (if you don't have it):
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- or update if you have it:
```shell
brew upgrade
```

- install `chruby` & `ruby-install`:
```shell
brew install chruby ruby-install xz
```

- install `ruby 3.1.3`:
```shell
ruby-install ruby 3.1.3
```

- configure environment:
```shell
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc
```

- look for actual ruby installed:
```shell
chruby
```

- install `jekyll` ruby gem:
```shell
gem install jekyll
```

- install/update all required gems
```shell
bundle update
```

- run the local server (`--livereload` since `3.7`)
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --livereload
```

- open in the browser:
```shell
open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

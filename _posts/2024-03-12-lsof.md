#### Who is listening my port

Time to time you run different stuff and forget to close it in a different terminal window.
So the task is to understand which app occupied it

```shell
lsof -i :8080
```

#### Which ports are listen on my machine

```shell
netstat -an | grep LIST
```

#### Which ports have open connections

```shell
netstat -an | grep EST
```

#### Look for java processes on my machine

```shell
jps
```

#### Look for all processes on my machine

```shell
ps ax
```

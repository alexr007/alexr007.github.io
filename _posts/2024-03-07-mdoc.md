### Amazing Markdown processor

suppose we have markdown file look like this

```text
```scala
   case class Point2d(x: Int, y: Int)
   val p = Point2d(10, 20)
``
```
by replacing `scala` with `scala mdoc`:
```text
```scala mdoc
   case class Point2d(x: Int, y: Int)
   val p = Point2d(10, 20)
``
```
we pass this snippet over its processing engine.
What it does, is:
- compiles the snippet
- runs it
- attaches compiler output to the same block:

```scala
case class Point2d(x: Int, y: Int)
val p = Point2d(10, 20)
// p: Point2d = Point2d(x = 10, y = 20)
```

by replacing `scala mdoc` with `scala mdoc:fail` it also attaches compiler output

```text
```scala mdoc:fail
sealed trait Color
case object Red extends Color
case object Yellow extends Color
case object Green extends Color

def show(c: Color): String = c match {
  case Red => "Red"
  case Green => "Green"
}
``
```

becomes

```scala
sealed trait Color
case object Red extends Color
case object Yellow extends Color
case object Green extends Color

def show(c: Color): String = c match {
  case Red => "Red"
  case Green => "Green"
}
// error: match may not be exhaustive.
// It would fail on the following input: Yellow
// Applicable -Wconf / @nowarn filters for this fatal warning: msg=<part of the message>, cat=other-match-analysis, site=repl.MdocSession.MdocApp.show
// def show(c: Color): String = c match {
//                              ^
```

by replacing `scala mdoc` with `scala mdoc:crash` it handles exceptions

```text
```scala mdoc:crash
println(1/0)
``
```

becomes

```scala
println(1/0)
// java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
// 	at repl.MdocSession$MdocApp$$anonfun$1.apply$mcV$sp(2024-03-15-why-scala.md:33)
// 	at repl.MdocSession$MdocApp$$anonfun$1.apply(2024-03-15-why-scala.md:33)
// 	at repl.MdocSession$MdocApp$$anonfun$1.apply(2024-03-15-why-scala.md:33)
```

- here is the link to [github](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc)
- here is the link to [documentation](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/)
- it has an `sbt` plugin which can do that as a part of `CI/CD` pipeline
- it has an ability to write own processors and inject whatever you need into your `.md` files

- the configuration is easy:
  - add one line to `plugins.sbt`
  ```scala
    addSbtPlugin("org.scalameta" % "sbt-mdoc" % "2.5.2")
  ```
  - add one more project to `build.sbt`:
  ```scala
    lazy val `xyz-docs` = (project in file("xyz-docs"))
      .enablePlugins(MdocPlugin)
  ```
  - put `.md` file(s) into `docs` folder (related to the project root)
  - inside `sbt` shell, run `xyz-docs/mdoc`
  - look for processed file(s) at `xyz-docs/target/mdoc` folder
